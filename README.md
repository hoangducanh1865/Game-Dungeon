### Story ###
Dungeon is an action-adventure game with a strong roguelike vibe, where players take on the role of a handsome and talented student at Hanoi University of Science and Technology. Because of his charm and abilities, he's admired and pursued by many girls. One day, a courageous female student confesses her feelings to him, but he bluntly rejects her, stating that he needs to focus on his studies and research.

Under the pressure of life and academics, coupled with the sting of rejection from her crush, the girl loses control and drives a car straight into the protagonist, causing him to be reincarnated into another world. In this new world, he becomes a skeleton with extraordinary magical abilities, far surpassing other creatures.

Despite his immense power, the protagonist is tormented by a single goal: returning to his original world. Using his magical abilities and extraordinary intelligence, he dedicates himself to crafting a portal that could bring him back. However, during one experiment, he accidentally opens a portal to the spirit world, allowing monstrous creatures to possess his powerful body while his soul disperses and inhabits a mere peasant.

Unwilling to accept his fate, armed with weapons forged from his scientific knowledge, he embarks on a dungeon-crawling adventure to reclaim his body. Dungeon is the story of the protagonistâ€™s journey to retrieve his formidable body. Join us on this epic quest!
